# Creative & Marketing

## Marketing Strategy

Define the overall marketing goal with each campaign. What do we wish to achieve with this marketing effort? Brand awareness for GDSC BPDC? Increased participation? Collaborated marketing effort for another club/association? 

Identify our target audience, topics that interest freshers may not neccesarily fall under the same interests as a final year students. Who are we trying to reach with your marketing messages? Tailor out content and approach to resonate with their needs and interests. Develop a clear value proposition. What makes our workshop or service unique and valuable? How will it benefit our target audience?

## Channels

At the moment we use channels such as Instagram, WhatsApp GroupChat Community and LinkedIn. Keep the text messages brief, it must not exceed more than what can fit one page of text when viewed using a mobile device. 

We can explore future options for niches such as Competitive Coding and CTF networks where a community based Discord/Slack Channel can be created. 

## Content Creation

- At the moment we use tools such as Figma, Photoshop and Canva. 
- Be consistent with placement of logos and always use BITS logo as recommended by institute. 
- Always tag council members when a story has been posted, reposting stories by council members can increase outreach!
- Maintain a consistent brand voice and visual identity across all marketing materials.

## Analytics

- Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to track the success of your marketing campaigns. These might include website traffic, engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
- Regularly monitor your analytics data to identify what's working and what's not. Try a mix of reels and posts. Use this information to optimize our marketing campaigns.
